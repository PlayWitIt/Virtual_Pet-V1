# Virtual_Pet-V1
Description
The Virtual Pet App is a fun, interactive simulation game created to demonstrate how to use ChatGPT for coding. Built with Python's tkinter library, this app allows users to engage in virtual pet care, including feeding, playing, and resting. This project serves as study material for understanding how AI-generated code can be used in practical applications.

Key Features
Feed Pet: Increase the pet's hunger and happiness levels by feeding it.
Play with Pet: Engage in playtime which affects the pet's energy and hunger.
Rest Pet: Restore the pet's energy and improve its happiness through rest.
Customize Pet: Change the pet's name.
Dynamic Environment: Visual representation of the pet's environment and movement.
Statistics: Track the pet's happiness, hunger, energy, and position over time.
Persistent Data: Saves and loads pet data to and from a JSON file.
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Clone or download the repository.
Since tkinter is part of the standard Python library, no additional installations are required.
Usage
Run the application by executing the script:
bash
Copy code
python pet_app.py
The app window will open, displaying your virtual pet.
Use the buttons to feed, play with, or rest the pet. You can also customize the pet's name.
The pet's status and environment will update dynamically.
Code Explanation
VirtualPet Class: Handles the behavior and attributes of the virtual pet, with methods for feeding, playing, resting, and moving.
PetApp Class: Manages the GUI using tkinter, allowing user interaction and displaying the pet's status and environment.
